            <h4>Source & Purpose</h4>
            <p>
              Vela is a concept app created during my UX course with Career Foundry. The primary learning objectives in the course were to master the application of UX design principles and heuristics, while designing a responsive mobile app.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app is primarily a weather tracking app that has been created to give surfers and kite surfers a better way of monitoring the weather with the aim being to ensure they are as safe as possible while doing what they love.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
              Surfers and kite surfers are not being satisfied when it comes to weather forecasting, which is displayed by the number of various weather platforms they use simultaneously. There is currently no one stop shop. On top of this,
              surfing and kite surfing have thus far been very isolated sports due to the nature of them. With all of the advances in technology and communication, this need not be the case any longer.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Project Goals</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><a>To deliver a personalised weather forecasting experience.</a></li>
              <li><a>To enhance the community within the surfing and kite surfing world through in app interactivity.</a></li>
              <li><a>To design a responsive app so that individuals can access the service via their mobile or desktop devices.</a></li>

            <h3>Cluster Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Surfers and kite surfers are not being satisfied whenFollowing the potential customer surveys and interviews, I created an affinity map to better visualise the the information gathered. From here I went on to undertake a cluster
              analysis to understand if there were any trends between the responses given by all of the interviewees.

                It better be worth it.
              </h5>
              <p>
                Water sports enthusiasts appear to be willing to put in a lot of effort if the perceived value they are getting back is worth it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Majority of interviewees indicated that they were traveling up to 4 hours in a day to do their sport.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>
                Why do i need this?
              </h5>
              <p>
                All of the interviewees stated that they use between 3 - 5 of the same weather conditions to gauge the likeness of them doing their sport.
              </p>
              <p>
                With customers' focus being on their end goal (sports), minimising the clutter and overwhelming weather statistics being displayed will advantages to them in making a decision faster.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>

              </h5>
              <p>
                Some of the interviewees find themselves having to travel back and forth between locations because weather forecasts aren't always accurate down to the hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                With their usually being other water sports enthusiasts at the destinations it would be more accurate to contact them directly.

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>
              Personas were generated on the back of the analysis and insights that came from the potential user interviews. They proved to be an integral part of the entire UX process as they were constantly referred back to when the design phase
              was under way and especially when the usefulness and and usability of design features came into question.

            <h3>User Journeys</h3>
            <p>
              User journeys, like persons were an extremely influential part of the design process as they helped to break down the users thoughts and feeling, as well as assisting in identifying possible pain points.

            <p>
              Understanding the personas potential user flow were critical when diving into the information architecture of the site and developing a site map to visualise it. With this being said, both the user flows and site map have been altered
              over time, with the emergence of new information derived from card sorts and usability testing.

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              Before laying down pen to paper and hashing out the initial wireframes based on my first attempt at creating the information architecture, I decided to conduct a card sort to ensure categories made logical sense to the end users. From
              this exercise, I decided that a few minor changes needed to be made to the structure before laying out initial concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tweaking of the information architecture did not stop here as later in the process I conducted a usability test on a prototype which lead to greater insights and need for change.

            <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Copious quantities of wireframes were created for each core feature of the app in a rapid fire timed concept generation process. They were all then subject to a thorough selection process, with the chosen wireframs being refined and
              taken forward into mid fidelity wireframes.

            <h3>Medium Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the time constraints of the project, there was not enough time to conduct a usability test at each level of wireframing and instead I had to use my best judgment, with help of the personas and user journeys, to make changes I
              thought were necessary between the phases.

            <p>
              Usability testing was conducted on the high fidelity prototype. This unveiled a few usability issues which needed to be addressed in a new revision. At this is point, it was clear to see that had the usability test been conducted
              earlier in the process, it would have resulted in saving a considerable amount of time and effort spent making changes to the high fidelity prototype. The screens shown here are of the revised prototype.
