              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                The portfolio website was created out of a desire to both have more control of the functionality and visual aspects of my website and to learn the basics of front end development. The website was built using the knowledge I gained in
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Having previously created websites using template services such a Square Space and Wix, I found that I was constantly frustrated by the lack of customisation and in a few cases the inability to create a responsive website. As a UX
              designer I not only need to create and present great digital experiences but I also have to ensure that the tools used to create these experiences can also be handed over to a developer to be brought to life. Therefore, I saw my
              previous frustration with website templates as an opportunity to
              learn the basics of front-end development and to create a responsive portfolio website that I would be happy displaying my work on.
            </p>

        <div class="row">

            <h3>Process and Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Before jumping straight into the coding side of the process, research was first conducted. The research process involved looking into other designers' portfolio websites and speaking to various recruiters and hiring managers about what
              they look for in a portfolio website. The research lead to a common response that the key aspect would be; easy navigation to both the about and contact sections while having the project example front and centre on
              the home page.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this day and age, where the devices people use every day vary drastically in size, it is no longer good enough to only have the website optimised for desktops. Therefore, the decision was made to create responsive website. To avoid
              confusion of potential employers, I opted to use a limited number of colours, clean typography and a simple layout.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest challenge I faced when building the website was understanding industry best practices of writing clean and easy to understand HTML code in a flexible and non redundant way. Learning how to wrap code and apply classes/IDs so
              that they could later be targeted by CSS styles was also an interesting learning curve and very fulfilling when executed correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with any design, the only way to know if it truly works is to test it. Through conducting usability tests, a number of minor inconveniences regarding navigation were brought to the surface. Many of the users tried to click on the
              project image or name on the home page to open the project instead of clicking on the “Read More” button. Luckily adding the code needed to give users the functionality of clicking through to the projects via the project images and
              names was an easy alteration to make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, when users browsed through the projects they failed to investigate the project’s prototype at the bottom of the page. With this being such an important part of the project I wanted to make sure users could find it
              immediately and so revised the design so that the prototype is placed at both the bottom and top of the page and is signified by a click-able image of the app and a prominent CTA button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the users navigated their way through the sight very easily without and major points of friction.

            <h3>Problems and Solution</h3>
            <p>
              When scaling the website down to a mobile screen size it was evident that the navigation was taking up too much screen space. To overcome this issue I used some JavaScript code, along with “em” and “media queries” to hide the
              navigation when not needed and to reduce it’s size once it had been opened up. </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this, I opted to use a single content column when users are browsing the website on small screens and two columns when users browsed on medium to large screens. This was also done using “em” and “media queries”.

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              This website has now been published and is working well across multiple platforms and screen sizes. The aesthetics of the website will be experimented on going forwards.
